# Tutorial: Creating a Virtual Environment in a Debian Server Using VSCode

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a Python virtual environment on a Debian server. We'll be using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for this tutorial.

## Steps

### Step 1: Open Terminal in VSCode

Launch VSCode and then open the terminal within the editor.

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Install the necessary Python package for creating virtual environments by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.8-venv
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Your Git Repository

Change your working directory to the location of your Git repository. For this tutorial, the repository is named `Analysis-of-Tweets-During-the-2021-Social-Unrest`. Run:

```bash
cd /mnt/disk2/Analysis-of-Tweets-During-the-2021-Social-Unrest
```

### Step 4: Create the Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment within your project directory by executing:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

Here, `myenv` is the name of your virtual environment. You can choose any name that you like.

### Step 5: Update `.gitignore`

To prevent your virtual environment from being tracked by Git, add the following lines to your `.gitignore` file:

```bash
# Ignore virtual environment folder in Git
myenv/
```

### Step 6: Close the Terminal

After you've completed these tasks, you can close the terminal.

### Step 7: Select the Virtual Environment in VSCode

1. Open the Command Palette in VSCode. You can access it by clicking `View` > `Command Palette` or by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux).
2. Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and select it from the dropdown.
3. A list of available Python interpreters will appear. Choose your virtual environment by navigating to `Enter interpreter path...` > `Find...` > `Analysis-of-Tweets-During-the-2021-Social-Unrest/myenv/bin/python`.

### Step 8: Manage `requirements.txt`

Before proceeding, check if a `requirements.txt` file already exists in the folder. If it does, install the listed dependencies. Otherwise, follow the steps below to create a new `requirements.txt` file.

#### If `requirements.txt` Exists:

Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### If `requirements.txt` Does Not Exist:

Create a new `requirements.txt` file to manage package dependencies and make it easier for other developers to set up their environment.

1. **Install `pipreqsnb`**:  
   This Python tool is designed for Jupyter notebooks and helps you create a `requirements.txt` file based on the packages used in your notebooks.

    ```bash
    pip install pipreqsnb
    ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Code Directory**:  
   Access the folder containing your Jupyter notebooks with the following command:

    ```bash
    cd Analysis-of-Tweets-During-the-2021-Social-Unrest/Code
    ```

3. **Generate `requirements.txt`**:  
   Create the `requirements.txt` file by running:

    ```bash
    pipreqsnb
    ```
