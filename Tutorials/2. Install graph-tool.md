# Installing graph-tool on a Debian Server

This guide is based on the installation instructions from this [official blog post](https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/-/wikis/installation-instructions).

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have gone through the tutorial "1. Create venv.md" before proceeding.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to the `/mnt/disk2` Directory

Open your terminal and ensure you're in the `/mnt/disk2` directory. If you're not, execute:

```bash
cd /mnt/disk2
```

### Step 2: Download and Install Anaconda

1. Visit the [official Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads) and find the `64-bit (x86) Installer`.
   
2. Download the installer script using `wget`. Replace the link with the most current version.
   
    ```bash
    sudo wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```
   
3. Run the Anaconda installer script:

    ```bash
    sudo bash Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```
   
    **Note**: Make sure to install Anaconda in the `/mnt/disk2/anaconda3` directory. Other partitions may not have sufficient disk space for the installation.

### Step 3: Add Conda to PATH

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor like `nano`:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
   
2. Append the following line to the end of the file:

    ```bash
    export PATH="/mnt/disk2/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    ```
   
3. Save the changes and source the updated `.bashrc` file:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

### Step 4: Install graph-tool Using Conda

Execute the following command to install `graph-tool`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool
```
