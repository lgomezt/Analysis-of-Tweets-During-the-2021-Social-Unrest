We define the $\\eta_1$ as the amount of nodes belonng to group $G_1$ and $\\eta_2$ belonging to group $G_2$. Recalling our past notation, in the contact Layer of the mixing matrix the number of between group ties will be the entry $M_{121}$.

This value will correspond to the number of nodes for group 1 multiplied to the number of nodes from group 2. The number of total cases will correspond to the number of dyads posible in the graph.

Suppose that its same-type friendships are 95% of its friendships. Compare this to a group that comprises 5% of a population and has 96% of its friendships being same-type. Although both have the same homophily index, they are very different in terms of how homophilous they are relative to how homophilous they could be. Comparing the homophily index, $ H_i $, to the baseline, $ w_i $, provides some information, but even that does not fully capture the idea of how biased a group is compared to how biased it could potentially be. To take care of this we use the inbreeding homophily index introduced by Coleman [Coleman J. (1958) *Human Organization* 17:28–36] that normalizes the homophily index by the potential extent to which a group could be biased.\n",

It can be easily checked that we have inbreeding homophily for type $ i $ if and only if $ IH_i > 0 $, and inbreeding heterophily for type $ i $ if and only if $ IH_i < 0 $. The index of inbreeding homophily is 0 if there is pure baseline homophily, and 1 if a group completely inbreeds."
